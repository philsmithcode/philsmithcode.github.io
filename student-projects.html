<h2>Student Projects</h2>

<a href="ProjectIdeas23.pdf">Project Ideas Presentation '23</a>

<br><br>
<p>I am particularly interested in supervising any projects with a basis in either Computational Linguistics or Natural Language Processing. In particular, my own research focuses on sentiment analysis.

<h3> Sentiment analysis:</h3>

<p> There are a number of ways of analysing the sentiment conveyed in text (knowledge-based, statistical...), and a number of levels at which sentiment can be communicated (phrase, sentence, document...). Additionally, texts don't solely convey a binary sentiment; a more fine-grained emotion or set of emotion may be intertwined with the meaning of the text. 

A student could focus on one or more of the following aspects of sentiment analysis:

<ul>
<li>Opinion retrieval</li>
<li>Opinion extraction</li>
<li>Opinion categorisation</li>
<li>Opinion summarisation</li>
<li>Visualisation techniques for sentiment in text</li>
<li>Applications of sentiment analysis to fake news detection</li>
<li>Detection of sentiment in social networks</li>
<li>Analysis of modality usage in opinionated communication</li>
<li>Multilinugal sentiment analysis</li>
<li> Rewriting sentiment of news stories - devloping software to alter 
the stance of an article.</li>
<li>Evaluating the emotion present in a textual dialogue (https://www.humanizing-ai.com/emocontext.html)</li>
<li>Monitoring the change of headline sentiment in online news websites</li>
</ul>

<p> I'd be happy for a student to investigate, one or a combination, of the approaches to sentiment analysis. Ideally I'd like a student to have some practical application in mind for the sentiment analysis software they develop, for example, a sentiment analysis app that could integrate with other apps on an Android mobile device, or integration with social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.

<h3>Software Development:</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>New for 2024! Game/Mobile App Development:</b> <a href="https://buttonshygames.com/">Button Shy Games</a> have published some incredible and highly recommended "wallet" card games that are perfect as the basis for game development such as Sprawlopolis, Skulls of Sedlec, Moving Pictures, Food Chain Island, Pentaquark, Ragemore, and Revolver Noir.
<!--<li> Closing time - I'm particularly interested in the way software has dissolved social and work-related boundaries. I'm proposing a project for an ambitious student to look at ways of re-establishing these boundaries via software. For example, given your work schedule something that is able to synchronise the ability to close down all technology and re-establish such important boundaries in a healthy way.
<li>Fantasy rugby application - this project would involve the design and implementation of a mobile/web app for the management of fantasy rugby teams and leagues.
<li>Table-top gaming application for phone or the web - this project would involve the design and implementation of a tabletop board game, such as <a href="https://www.bloodbowl.com/">Blood Bowl</a>.
<li>A computer vision project to recognise the values rolled on unusually shaped dice.

</ul>
